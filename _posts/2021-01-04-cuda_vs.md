So, you've got the CUDA Toolkit installed (11.2).  You've got the samples
building in MsDev.  You've made it, it's time to start your own project! 
You stare at
MsDev and realize, "I don't know how to
create a Dev Studio project that has all the CUDA specific project and build
settings.  FML."  Never fear, Cindy Bui has the answer, here:

Thank you, Cindy!
